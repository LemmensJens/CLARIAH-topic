This repository contains code for the topic modeling pipeline for the CLARAIH-VL DTADP. 
First, install Spacy's Dutch model with '''python -m spacy download nl_core_news_sm''' and the other requirements with '''pip install -r requirements.txt'''.
For a demonstration of the code, add a corpus to the config file and run '''python topic_modeling.py'''.
